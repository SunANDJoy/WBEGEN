# combinedImputeGEX
Code used to impute tissue-specific gene expression level using genotype and whole blood expression as predictors.


## Notice
The purpose of this repository is to share the code used in the study: "Building an optimal predictive model for imputing tissue-specific gene expression by combining genotype and whole blood transcriptome data".
We are not able to share the data used in the study due to the license issue. We instead include a detailed description on how to prepare and use the data to run our code within the README file.


## Data download
We obtained the data from GTEx v7 database. The data include tissue-specific gene expression profile, whole blood transcriptome profile, and genotype information.
